## About Me

My name is Naya Singhania and I am from the Bay Area in California. I have been coding since I was 12 and since then, I have become highly proficient in Next.js, Python, Java, UI design and other frameworks, languages, and development tools. I am now starting my third year as a computer science major at San Jos√© State University, as well as working towards a certificate in computational linguistics. I am currently working on a few applications that I hope will truly help people in their day-to-day lives, as well as contributing to various open-source projects in the community

Besides majoring in and having a deep passion for computer science, I am strong in my academics and I enjoy producing music!
