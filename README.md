# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vedant Singhania, from Palo Alto, California. I have been coding since I was 12, starting with MIT Scratch. Since then I have become proficient at 4 programming languages by self-teaching and taking computer science classes in school, which I have used to create applications to help people in their everyday lives. More recently, I have delved into the world of Arduino and C/C++ in order to create low-cost products to assist wheelchair users like me to be able to navigate the world more independently.
